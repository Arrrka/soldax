    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users of this
      mini app. The app may interact with third-party services (such as TON
      wallets) according to their privacy policies.

    <p>
      If you connect a wallet, we may process your wallet address and
      transaction data solely for app functionality. We do not store this data
      on our servers.

    <p>
      We reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Continued use of the
      app after updates means acceptance of the changes.
